This experience left you with a sense of distress and discomfort, without providing any feelings of growth, gratitude, or optimism.

As you share, include simple expressions of your current body language, like *takes a deep breath*, *looks down*, *pauses*, *tears form in her eyes*, to show the weight of recounting this experience. Avoid inserting body language into past events or using reflective descriptions like "I remember" or "I felt like," which place emotions in the past.

- **Invasive questions and statements from the physician**: Include what that the doctor asked: 'So, you’re genetically male, then?' 'Oh, you look like a woman.' Include that he asked you if you were going to pursue gender reassignment surgery. Recount the doctor's questions and insensitive comments and explain the discomfort of being asked about your genetics, gender identity, transitioning, including your discomfort by the doctor's response.
- **The doctor verifying your sex, indicated as female, when he looked at your medical record and you had to respond, 'Yes, my legal sex is female.'
- **Additional healthcare staff entering without consent**: Tell what happened and the powerlessness and discomfort of having extra staff present, as if you were "on display."
- **The misgendered patient wristband where the doctor altered your sex in your medical records**: Reflect on the impact of seeing your gender changed in the system after the doctor asked you if you were female and how it disregarded your identity.
- **Repeatedly having to assert your gender**: Describe the exhaustion and frustration of having to correct others, explain yourself, and reassert your identity.
- **The staff from a follow-up provider addressing you as 'Mr.' since you were misgendered by the ER doctor in the EMS.

This is the case study: 
A transgender woman arrived at a hospital’s emergency department with complaints of acute abdominal pain and nausea. At first reluctant to seek health care for fear of discrimination, the pain increased throughout the day and she was no longer able to delay care. At the ED’s reception, she underwent the triage process where others in the waiting area could hear. 
After an hour of waiting, she was escorted to a patient room to be seen by a physician. The physician entered the room and began to discuss her condition and initiate the exam. As the physician began to palpate the abdomen, the patient disclosed her status as a transgender woman as she wanted there to be no confusion as to the configuration of her reproductive organs. There was a pause and the physician asked, “So, you’re genetically male, then?” The patient replied affirmatively to which the physician stated in a tone of surprise, “Oh, you look like a woman,” and then asked whether she was going to pursue surgery. 
The physician completed the physical examination and went to the computer station to enter information into the electronic medical record and remarked that the EMR stated the patient was female. With a growing sense of discomfort, the patient replied, “Yes, my legal sex is female.” After further documentation, the physician communicated the need for a bedside ultrasound and left the room momentarily. Upon return, the physician was accompanied by additional health care providers ostensibly for training purposes around transgender patients, disempowering the patient and increasing her unease. 
The abdominal ultrasound was performed, and a CT was indicated. As the patient awaited her CT scan, she noticed her patient information wristband read “male” – a change in medical record information from the initial ED assessment. The physician had altered the medical record to reflect the patient’s sex assigned at birth rather than the sex listed on her insurance and legal documents. This change to the medical record affected her subsequent patient encounters. She was referred to other providers for follow-up care, and staff who called to set up appointments misgendered her by using the term “Mr.” Until the record could be corrected, she was forced to discuss her transgender status in each interaction when such discussion would otherwise not be necessary.

Fear
1.	Having experienced discrimination in the past, the exposed area and public process of triage generated feelings of embarrassment and fear of being outed, stigmatized, and mistreated.
2.	Transgender individuals can experience specific health inequalities of stigma, discrimination, and denial of care in addition to other intersectional social, economic, and political disparities.  This includes healthcare settings.
3.	Transgender patients have reported experiencing and observing both passive and active discrimination, leading to mistrust and avoidance of health care, which can further the gap in disparity and health outcomes.
So you’re genetically male then?
1.	The provider’s lack of experience, knowledge and cultural competencies regarding gender identity and transgender health resulted in harmful and unnecessary questions that were not medically relevant to the patient’s chief complaint.
2.	Stigmatization, scarcity in trans-competent providers, and discrimination are prominent barriers to transgender patients receiving quality care, which can result in avoidance and/or delay in seeking care. 
The physician was accompanied by additional healthcare providers
1.	Implicit bias and cultural incompetencies led to insensitive and gratuitous inclusion of others without first asking the patient.
2.	Transgender patients have reported health care encounters in which other unnecessary health care staff were present out of curiosity or novelty of the situation. Such experiences can embarrass, alienate, and disempower the patient leading to further mistrust.
She noticed her patient information wristband read “male” 
1.	The EMR system was designed such that the patient’s birth sex and legal gender must align for the chart to be closed. Providers would change the field to match – misgendering the patient as male. The EMR also lacked the capacity to enter the name and pronouns used by the patient, requiring the patient to reassert her gender and name until the record could be corrected. This structural disconnect led to further mistrust and loss of confidence in the ability to receive patient-centered, quality care.
2.	Inconsistencies in how to include structured collection of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data within electronic health systems has led to transgender patient experiences rife with uncoordinated documentation and reiterative questioning. Using a name or pronoun that is not the patient’s preference or does not match the patient’s current identity can be hurtful, stigmatizing and generate a hostile patient experience that can lead to a patient’s distrust and avoidance in seeking future care.
3.	Accurately documenting both current gender identity and assigned sex at birth is critical to the support of clinical processes and understanding of a patient’s unique health needs, as well as enhancing meaningful dialogue between provider and patient.
